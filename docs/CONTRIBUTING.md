# CONTRIBUTING.md

## Contributing to NebulaDesk Core

Thanks for considering a contribution! This project is **local-first** and **privacy-by-design**.

### Ways to contribute
- File issues (bugs, UX, docs)
- Propose widgets (JSON + minimal logic)
- Improve security/CSP and schema validation
- Docs & examples

### Ground rules
- No analytics/trackers
- Network access must be explicit and least-privilege
- Keep PRs small and focused
- Add tests/docs where relevant

### Dev setup
1. Clone and serve:
   - `python3 -m http.server 8000` or any static server
2. Open `http://localhost:8000`
3. Work in feature branches; open a PR with context.

### Code of Conduct
We follow a standard, respectful collaboration policy (see `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).
